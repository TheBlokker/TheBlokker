Welcome to my profile!
=========================

👋 Hi there! I’m Timm, a student with a passion for programming, exploring the world of code for the past 4 years. My journey has led me to work with Python, C#, Java, and front-end web development, and I'm always looking to learn more and tackle new challenges.

🚀 Here, you’ll find a collection of projects that showcase my skills and ideas—from creative web designs to software solutions. Whether you’re here to explore, collaborate, or provide feedback, I’d love to connect with you and build something awesome together!

Happy coding! 😊
